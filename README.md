Nothing special, but since I worked on this project with coding, I wanted to add some interaction. If you hover your mouse on the Billboard list, the song will be playing too!

### Project Description

K-pop has conquered the world. The mass media say everyday that K-culture is now recognized as a trend anywhere in the world. However, some point out that because of this internationalization trend, English is rather swallowing Korean lyrics up. So I wanted to find out if the problem is that serious. I looked at the level of English use in the past and what it is like these days through data. This visualization shows how English has permeated K-pop from the 1990s to the 2020s. Feel free to explore whether K-pop has really conquered by English.
